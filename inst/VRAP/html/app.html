    VRAPS implements the Viability and Risk Assessment Procedure model
    used to assess the effect of harvest and bycatch on protected
    salmon populations.
  </p>
  <p>
    VRAPS estimates the probability of hitting particular upper recovery
    targets and lower recovery thresholds under different harvest
    rates (or bycatch rates). The model is also used to assess the
    level of productivity and capacity needed to sustain a viable
    population given a specified level of harvest (or bycatch).
  </p>
  <p>
    From Sands (2013): "The Viability and Risk Assessment Procedure
    (VRAP) model was adapted from the Risk Assessment Procedure (RAP)
    original developed by Jim Scott (WDFW) and Bob Hayman (Skagit
    Coop) in the 1990â€™s. The original purpose of the model was to
    assess the impact of various harvest rates on salmon populations
    based on the variance in returns and in management precision,
    including a harvest rate scale based on size of the returns. The
    model was based on the assumption of density dependence in
    recruits per spawner and introduced stochasticity in the estimates
    with variance estimates around the fit of the data to the
    predicted spawner-recruit curve and in management error."
  </p>
  <p>
    VRAPS is based on simulating from an estimated SR function and
    age-structure. These estimated functions are output from the
    "Dynamic Model" using A & P files as input.
