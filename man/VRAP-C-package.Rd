\title{
  VRAP with C++ for RER and Viability Computations
}
\description{
  This is a rewrite of the R version of the VRAP program.  The original VRAP R package was a one-to-one translation from the original Visual Basic code.  VRAP-C is the same equations, but completely re-written by Martin Liermann to be more efficient.  VRAP-C does not have all the functionality of VRAP. Many of the rav options in VRAP were not used and are removed.
