Description: This is a rewrite of the R version of the VRAP program.  
  The original VRAP R package was a one-to-one translation from the original 
  Visual Basic code.  VRAPCpp is the same equations, but completely re-written 
  by Martin Liermann to be more efficient.  VRAPCpp does not have all the 
  functionality of VRAP. Many of the rav options in VRAP were not used and are 
  removed.  There is a shiny that emulates the VRAP 1.0 shiny app.
